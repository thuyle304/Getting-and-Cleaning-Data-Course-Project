There are two datasets created:
================================
1. "mdata"" with following variables:
- 1st column: Subjects
- 2nd column: activities
- 3rd - 87th column: figures for a certain measurement (which is only mean and standard deviation) of subject in the activity. These features are selected by extracting all the names with "mean" or "std" from the list available in 'features.txt'. Feature Selection for the list in 'features.txt' is explained in "feature_info.txt"

2. "secondata"" with following variables:
- 1st column: Subjects
- 2nd column: activities
- 3rd - 87th column: the average of each variable which is included in mdata for each activity and each subject
